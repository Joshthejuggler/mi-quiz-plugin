## How It Works

### 1. Self-Assessment Flow
User selects 6-10 adjectives from 8 MI domains:
- **Linguistic**: Articulate, Expressive, Persuasive, Eloquent, Verbal, Communicative, Storyteller
- **Logical-Mathematical**: Analytical, Logical, Systematic, Objective, Precise, Curious, Problem-Solving
- **Spatial-Visual**: Imaginative, Inventive, Observant, Aesthetic, Detailed, Conceptual, Visual
- **Bodily-Kinesthetic**: Energetic, Graceful, Coordinated, Hands-On, Grounded, Active, Practical
- **Musical**: Rhythmic, Harmonious, Attuned, Expressive, Melodic, Sensitive, Creative
- **Interpersonal**: Empathetic, Collaborative, Friendly, Supportive, Sociable, Encouraging, Persuasive
- **Intrapersonal**: Reflective, Self-Aware, Thoughtful, Authentic, Insightful, Mindful, Intuitive
- **Naturalistic**: Observant, Grounded, Curious, Eco-Aware, Connected, Nurturing, Practical

### 2. Peer Feedback System  
- Share UUID-secured link with 2-5 trusted contacts
- Peers complete anonymous 6-10 adjective selection
- IP tracking prevents duplicate submissions
- Email notification when 2+ peers complete

### 3. Johari Window Calculation
- **Open**: Adjectives selected by both self AND peers (known strengths)
- **Blind**: Selected by peers but NOT self (blind spots to work on)
- **Hidden**: Selected by self but NOT peers (private strengths to share)
- **Unknown**: Selected by neither (unexplored potential)

### 4. Results & Visualization
- Interactive 4-quadrant Johari Window
- Color-coded by MI domain for deeper insights  
- Domain-level breakdown and summary
- PDF export with full report
- Mobile-responsive design
