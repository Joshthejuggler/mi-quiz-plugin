## Locations Where Logo Appears

2. **Quiz Results Pages** - All three quizzes (MI, CDT, Bartle)
3. **Email Templates** - PDF attachments and email headers
4. **Generated PDFs** - When users download their results

## Notes

- All references to the old remote logo URL have been removed
- Logo alt text has been updated to be more descriptive
- The logo will now load from your local WordPress media library
- No CSS changes were needed as the existing `.site-logo` class styling remains the same

## Testing

After these changes, the new SOSD logo should appear in:
- [ ] Dashboard header (logged in)
- [ ] Dashboard header (logged out) 
- [ ] MI Quiz results page
- [ ] CDT Quiz results page
- [ ] Bartle Quiz results page
- [ ] Email notifications (when results are sent)
- [ ] PDF downloads

The logo should maintain its responsive sizing and positioning as defined by the existing CSS rules.
