"Your MI profile shows {mi_strengths}, and your CDT results highlight {cdt_strengths}. Taken together, this pairing points toward the Explorer Player Type—curious, adaptive, and motivated by discovery. It’s the way your learning strengths and your openness to uncertainty reinforce each other that makes exploration natural for you. Still, Achiever, Socializer, or Strategist traits may also influence you. The Bartle Player Type quiz will confirm.";

$player_type_templates['explorer'][] =
"With {mi_strengths} shaping how you learn and {cdt_strengths} showing how you handle inner conflict, you may resonate with the Explorer type. This blend suggests a drive toward novelty, patterns, and experimentation. Because your style combines curiosity with tolerance for ambiguity, exploration may be your strongest motivation. Yet Achiever focus, Socializer warmth, or Strategist edge could also play a role. The Player Type quiz will reveal your unique balance.";

$player_type_templates['explorer'][] =
"Your results suggest a blend of {mi_strengths} alongside {cdt_strengths}. Together, they lean toward the Explorer Player Type—thriving on curiosity, openness, and discovery.

The Player Type quiz will clarify how these fit together for you.";

$player_type_templates['explorer'][] =
"Explorers are motivated by learning for its own sake, and your MI strengths ({mi_strengths}) plus your CDT profile ({cdt_strengths}) suggest you may fit this style. The way your intelligence patterns and your conflict style align points toward discovery as a core drive. But Achiever, Socializer, and Strategist aspects could also be shaping you. The Player Type quiz will show the full picture.";

$player_type_templates['explorer'][] =
"With {mi_strengths} guiding your abilities and {cdt_strengths} shaping your approach, you appear aligned with the Explorer Player Type. This combination highlights a curiosity that thrives when paired with openness to complexity. Still, Achiever, Socializer, and Strategist motivations may play supporting roles. The Player Type quiz will confirm.";

$player_type_templates['explorer'][] =
"Your profile—{mi_strengths} combined with {cdt_strengths}—hints at the Explorer Player Type. This fit makes sense because the way you learn and the way you manage tension both point toward discovery and curiosity. But you may also recognize yourself in the drive of Achievers, the connection of Socializers, or the competitiveness of Strategists. The quiz will reveal how these blend together.";

$player_type_templates['achiever'][] =
"Your MI strengths ({mi_strengths}) paired with your CDT profile ({cdt_strengths}) point toward the Achiever Player Type. This is because your learning style and your way of handling challenge both reinforce goal-setting and persistence. Achievers thrive on progress, goals, and measurable success. Still, Explorer curiosity, Socializer connection, or Strategist competitiveness may also shape you. The Player Type quiz will confirm.";

$player_type_templates['achiever'][] =
"With {mi_strengths} guiding your skills and {cdt_strengths} influencing your responses to conflict, you may align with the Achiever type.

$player_type_templates['achiever'][] =
"Your blend of {mi_strengths} and {cdt_strengths} leans toward the Achiever Player Type—focused on growth, mastery, and reaching milestones.

"Achievers are motivated by measurable progress, and your MI ({mi_strengths}) plus CDT ({cdt_strengths}) suggest you may resonate with this type.

The Player Type quiz will help clarify.";

"Your results—{mi_strengths} paired with {cdt_strengths}—suggest an Achiever orientation. This makes sense because your strengths highlight both structured learning and resilience under challenge.

"With {mi_strengths} as a foundation and {cdt_strengths} guiding your resilience, your profile points toward the Achiever type.

The Player Type quiz will confirm your dominant style.";

$player_type_templates['socializer'][] =
"Your MI profile ({mi_strengths}) combined with CDT strengths ({cdt_strengths}) suggests you may lean toward the Socializer Player Type.

The quiz will help you discover which stands strongest.";

$player_type_templates['socializer'][] =
"Socializers value connection and shared learning. Your MI ({mi_strengths}) and CDT ({cdt_strengths}) suggest this may be a core part of you, since your learning and dissonance patterns both support collaboration.

"With {mi_strengths} guiding your intelligence profile and {cdt_strengths} shaping how you face conflict, you appear aligned with the Socializer type.

Still, you may also carry Explorer, Achiever, or Socializer tendencies that influence how you play and grow. The Player Type quiz will help confirm.";

$player_type_templates['strategist'][] =
"Strategists thrive when there’s something or someone to beat. With {mi_strengths} shaping your profile and {cdt_strengths} showing how you respond to conflict, this may be your style.

Yet you may also find yourself exploring, achieving, or socializing as part of your motivation. The Player Type quiz will show where you stand.";
